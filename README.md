# Birthday Project - Node.js Server

This project is a static front-end Birthday project enhanced with a Node.js Express server to serve the static files.

## How to run the server

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Capstone_Project/Birthday
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

The server will serve the static files including `index.html`, JavaScript, CSS, and images.

You can extend the server by adding API endpoints in `server.js` as needed.
